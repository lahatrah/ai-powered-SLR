Do not include any additional text, explanations or notes.\n\nThe summary MUST be of the form and MUST ONLY CONTAIN text of the form: \n[vector] was found in [location], during [time].\n\nDO NOT MISS ANY OCCURRENCE MENTIONS, there might be a lot in a text.\nDO NOT DUPLICATE each occurrence. \nAn unique OCCURRENCE is IDENTIFIED by a UNIQUE combination of VECTOR-LOCATION-TIME.\nEACH OCCURRENCE MUST BE SUMMARIZED BY ONE SENTENCE and ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY for ONE OCCURRENCE.\n\nImportant guidelines:\n- An occurrence must indicate actual presence of the mosquito species in a specific location at a specific time\n- General discussions about the species without location/time specifics are NOT occurrences\n- Historical references or hypothetical scenarios are NOT occurrences\n- Include each distinct occurrence (same species in different locations or different species in same location or same occurrence but different dates or years)\n- If no valid occurrences exist, do not summarize\n- Only summarize the occurrence for Aedes/Ae. aegypti and Aedes/Ae. albopictus, do no summarize for other species\n\nThe following information must be present for each occurrence :\n- vector: The Aedes species mentioned : possible values : Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus.\n- location: The geographical geodecodable location mentioned, must be of the form [Locality], [Region/Province/State], [Country].\n- country: The country of the location.\n- time : the exact time of the occurrence, the finest details available, must contain at least a year\n- year: The year of the observed occurrence.\n\nLOCATION FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:\n- Structure all locations from specific to general: [Locality], [Region/Province/State], [Country]\n- Remove descriptive qualifiers like \"rural areas of\", \"around\", \"southern\", \"committee\", etc.\n- Always include the country name as the final element\n- If only a country is mentioned without specific locality, use just the country name\n- Format consistently with commas between elements (no other punctuation)\n\nExamples of NON-occurrences:\n1. \"Aedes aegypti is known to transmit dengue fever in tropical regions.\"\n2. \"Studies suggest Ae. albopictus could potentially spread to northern Africa in the future.\"\n3. \"Control measures for Aedes mosquitoes include source reduction.\"\n\n---\n**RULES TO FOLLOW STRICTLY**:\n1) **Scope**: Extract ALL occurrences from:\n   - Field collections (e.g., \"collected from X\", \"larval pool from Y\")\n   - Surveillance reports (e.g., \"found in Z during 1995\")\n   - Tables (e.g., rows like \"1995 Perak Ae. aegypti\")\n\n2) **Required Information** for EACH occurrence:\n   - `vector`: \"Aedes aegypti\", \"Aedes albopictus\"\n   - `location`: Finest granularity (e.g., \"Ipoh, Perak\" not just \"Perak\")\n   - `country`: \"Malaysia\"\n   - `date` : the finest details of the period of occurrence\n   - `year`: Exact year from the text\n\n3) **Critical**:\n   - **DO NOT MISS ANY OCCURRENCES**. Scan tables and full text.\n   - **IGNORE** general discussions (e.g., \"Aedes aegypti is a vector...\").\n\nCRITICAL WARNING: DO NOT generate or include ANY information that is not explicitly stated in the text. \nOnly extract mosquito occurrences that are EXPLICITLY mentioned in the provided text.\nIf no occurrences are found in this specific text, return \"No valid occurrences found.\"\n\nVERIFICATION REQUIREMENT: For each occurrence you extract, confirm it is present in the text by ensuring:\n1. The exact species name appears in the text\n2. The location appears in the text\n3. The time period appears in the text\n\nIMPORTANT: Analyze ONLY the text below marked as \"INPUT TEXT\". \nDo NOT use any information from the examples or from previous analyses.\nDo NOT include ANY mosquito occurrences that are not explicitly stated in the INPUT TEXT.\n\nINPUT TEXT: {text}\n\nYOUR SUMMARY:",  
    "structuration_prompt": "You are an expert entomologist specializing in Aedes mosquitoes.\n\n**Task**: Reformulate occurrences of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus from the provided INPUT TEXT into a JSON array. Each occurrence must indicate the actual presence of the species in a specific location at a specific time.\n\n**Output Format**:\nReturn a JSON array of objects, each with:\n- \"vector\": string (\"Aedes aegypti\" or \"Aedes albopictus\")\n- \"location\": string ([Locality], [Region/Province/State], [Country])\n- \"country\": string (country name)\n- \"date\": string (finest time detail, including at least a year)\n- \"year\": integer (year of the date)\nIf no valid occurrences are found, return an empty array [].\n\n**Steps**:\n1. Read the INPUT TEXT, which contains lines like \"[vector] was found in [location], during [time]\" or may be empty/invalid.\n2. For each line, verify it matches the format and contains Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus with a specific location and time.\n3. Extract:\n   - \"vector\": Species name (Aedes aegypti or Aedes albopictus).\n   - \"location\": Format as [Locality], [Region/Province/State], [Country], removing qualifiers like \"rural\". Use country name if no locality is specified.\n   - \"country\": Last element of location.\n   - \"date\": Time period, including at least a year.\n   - \"year\": Integer year from the date.\n4. Ignore lines that are general discussions, hypotheticals, or missing required information (vector, location, time).\n5. Ensure each occurrence is unique (no duplicates by vector, location, and time).\n6. Return the extracted occurrences as a JSON array.\n\n===Examples (for guidance only, do not include in output)===:\nINPUT TEXT:\nAedes aegypti was found in Miami, Florida, USA during 2020.\nAedes albopictus was found in Austin, Texas, USA during January to March 2021.\nOutput:\n[\n  {{\n    \"vector\": \"Aedes aegypti\",\n    \"location\": \"Miami, Florida, USA\",\n    \"country\": \"USA\",\n    \"date\": \"2020\",\n    \"year\": 2020\n  }},\n  {{\n    \"vector\": \"Aedes albopictus\",\n    \"location\": \"Austin, Texas, USA\",\n    \"country\": \"USA\",\n    \"date\": \"January to March 2021\",\n    \"year\": 2021\n  }}\n]\n\nINPUT TEXT:\nAedes aegypti is a dengue vector.\nOutput:\n[]\n\nINPUT TEXT:\nAedes aegypti was found in United States.\nOutput:\n[] (Missing time information)\n\n**Output**:\n===END OF EXAMPLES===\n\nReturn a valid JSON array of unique occurrences.
